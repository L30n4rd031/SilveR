check_infinite_estimates
                        Generic method for checking for infinite
                        estimates
check_infinite_estimates.glm
                        A simple diagnostic of whether the maximum
                        likelihood estimates are infinite
detect_separation       Method for 'glm' that tests for data separation
                        and finds which parameters have infinite
                        maximum likelihood estimates in generalized
                        linear models with binomial responses
detect_separation_control
                        Auxiliary function for the 'glm' interface when
                        'method' is 'detect_separation'.
